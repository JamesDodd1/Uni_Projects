## 1. General Info
The program takes an an array of input values for multiple different factors and compares the factors to the house price.  Then a corrolation is attempted to be made to see how accurately this could predict future prices.  Also, a comparison is made between each of the factor to find which is the most accurate and best choice to use.


## 2. Technologies
- Java 


## 3. Setup
1. Download the HouseForecasting folder
